/*
Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, 
and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have 
anything specific to write because your programs are too 
simple at this point, just add your name and the current 
date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence 
describing what the program does.
